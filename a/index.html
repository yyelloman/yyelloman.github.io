            <p>I'm Isaac, or online Yello. I'm a Filipino junior high school student living in the Philippines. I'm a devout Christian trying to be more Christlike, and I'm interested in philosophy, theology and church history. I know how to program in Luau and C++. I don't really think I'm that great in the things I do or know.</p>
