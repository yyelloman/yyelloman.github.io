                    Hi. I did another site update.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've removed the underline from the links above
                    because underlines on initials mean that there
                    are keybinds for them. I've made the list of
                    blog posts look better. I've also updated the
                    styling - I've made the navbar smaller and made
                    it shrink when you scroll down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think what I want to do next is make the site
                    look better on mobile, and also make it so that
                    I won't have to manually add every blog post to
                    /b/ and recent ones to the main page.
                </p>
                <p>Ok thanks bye</p>
